# Data Science Final Proj. Feature Extraction 

## Data
-  train 1 complement
-  train 1 trend
-  train 1 seasonality
-  train 1 residual
-  train 2 complement
-  train 2 trend
-  train 2 seasonality
-  train 2 residual

## Seasonal Decompose
- Using **additive** model: which means 
 ` result = Trend + Seasonal + Residual`, and the period is set to `7` temporarily 

## Complement Missing Value
- using KNN to impute missing value temporarily
- time series will be remove if missing value is higher than **50%** 

## Usage
